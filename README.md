## Introduction

In this repository, you'll find JavaScript implementations of fundamental data structures and algorithms. Each data structure or algorithm is accompanied by detailed explanations and examples to help you understand its usage and implementation.

## Data Structures

### Linked List

A linked list is a linear data structure where elements are stored in nodes. Each node contains a data field and a reference (link) to the next node in the sequence.

### Array

An array is a data structure that stores a collection of elements, each identified by at least one array index.

### Stack

A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle. Elements can be added or removed only from the top of the stack.

### Queue

A queue is a linear data structure that follows the First In, First Out (FIFO) principle. Elements can be added from the rear and removed from the front.

### Hash Table

A hash table is a data structure that stores key-value pairs. It uses a hash function to compute an index into an array where the value can be inserted or found.

### Tree

A tree is a hierarchical data structure consisting of nodes connected by edges. Each node has a parent and zero or more children.

### Graph

A graph is a non-linear data structure consisting of nodes (vertices) and edges. Graphs can be directed or undirected, and they can have weighted or unweighted edges.

## LeetCode Solutions

This section contains solutions to problems from LeetCode, a platform for practicing coding interview questions. Each solution includes a problem statement, an explanation of the approach used, and the corresponding JavaScript code.
